                    The Teatro Colón (Spanish: Columbus Theatre) is the main opera house. It is considered one of the ten
                    best opera houses in the world by National Geographic, and is acoustically considered
                    to be amongst the five best concert venues in the world. The present Colón replaced an original
                    theatre which opened in 1857. Towards the end of the century it became clear that a new theatre
                    was needed and, after a 20-year process, the present theatre opened on 25 May 1908, with Giuseppe
                    Verdi's Aïda.

                    In general, the climate in Buenos Aires is mild all year round, with no major extremes of temperature
                    or conditions. However, some people may find the summer months too hot and humid (Dec-Feb; average
                    highs of 28C/83F, average lows of 17C/63F), or the winter months a little cold (Jun-Aug; average
                    highs of 15C/59F, average lows of 7C/47F), obviously depending on what kind of weather you are used
                    to at home. Few will argue that spring is the best time to visit Buenos Aires (Sep-Nov; average
                    highs of 22C/72F, average lows of 14C/57F), which is closely followed by autumn/fall (Mar-May;
                    average highs of 22C/72F, average lows of 14C/57F).
