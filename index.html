        real estate in the city.</p>

        <h1>Landmarks</h1>

        <h2>Caminito</h2>
        <p>Caminito ("little path" in Spanish) is a street museum and a traditional alley, located in La Boca. The place acquired cultural significance because it inspired the music for the famous tango "Caminito" (1926), composed by Juan de Dios Filiberto.</p>

        <h1>Weather</h1>
        <p>In general, the climate in Buenos Aires is mild all year round, with no major extremes of temperature or conditions. However, some people may find the summer months too hot and humid (Dec-Feb; average highs of 28C/83F, average lows of 17C/63F), or the winter months a little cold (Jun-Aug; average highs of 15C/59F, average lows of 7C/47F), obviously depending on what kind of weather you are used to at home. Few will argue that spring is the best time to visit Buenos Aires (Sep-Nov; average highs of 22C/72F, average lows of 14C/57F), which is closely followed by autumn/fall (Mar-May; average highs of 22C/72F, average lows of 14C/57F).</p>
